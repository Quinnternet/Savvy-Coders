# Savvy Coders Capstone Project

## Definition of audience
The audience for this web app is career coaches, recruiters, teachers, and anyone who wants to have easy access to scheduling, planning, and socializing apps in one page.

## Definition statement
I want to create a web app that combines some pre-existing features into an easy-to-read dashboard which will display a variety of useful things.

## Elevator pitch
My goal here is to create a dashboard to allow easy access to a number of useful widgets all in one page, similar to Google's old customizable home page from years ago.  My app will display a fillable calendar, a weather widget, an RSS/news feed, and a social media feed. This will be perfect for anyone who, like me, forgets things easily and would benefit from having their appointments, news, and social media all on one screen without having to tab back and forth or open separate apps for everything.
